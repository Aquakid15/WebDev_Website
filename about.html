                <h2>My Hobbies & Interests Beyond Coding</h2>
                <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring various interests that help me grow as a person:</p>
                
                <div class="hobby-section">
                    <h3>Reading & Personal Development</h3>
                    <p>I'm passionate about personal growth and self-improvement literature. My favorite book is <em>Power vs Force</em> by David R. Hawkins, which explores consciousness and human behavior through a fascinating lens. I find that reading about psychology and philosophy helps me become a better problem solver and critical thinker.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="hobby-section">
                    <h3>Athletics & Competitive Sports</h3>
                    <p>I'm a competitive swimmer and love pushing my limits in the pool. Beyond swimming, I enjoy running and mountain biking, which help me stay in shape and clear my mind. I believe in maintaining a healthy balance between screen time and physical activity—these sports not only keep me fit but also boost my creativity and focus when I return to coding projects.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="hobby-section">
                    <h3>Music & Creative Outlets</h3>
                    <p>Music is a constant companion while I code and study. I've played the cello for 8 years, which has taught me discipline, patience, and the value of consistent practice—skills that translate directly to my coding journey. I appreciate how different genres can influence mood and productivity, and I'm always discovering new artists and sounds that inspire my creative work.</p>
